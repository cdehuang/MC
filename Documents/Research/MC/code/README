Updated:

conversion.py
removed debug.py
monte_carlo.py (didn’t really do anything…it seems fine)


new_volfun.py is the rewritten version of volfun.py (which is modified code from Leonidas). It's better than the old one because you can put in a paramter file of all the clusters, their deflection maps, and other stuff that you want to look at.
