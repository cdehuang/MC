1. Make a file of the observations in your survey (as a .csv or as a .dat file). 
2. If using a .csv, you can use "conversion.py" to divide this into multiple .dat files by the limiting magnitude (assumes that one survey has the same limiting magnitude). 
3. Then proceed to edit the sn_param.cfg and put in the name of the file that you converted it to under 'observations' 
4.
